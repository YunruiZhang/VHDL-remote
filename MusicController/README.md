# MusicController

Firstly you might want to use *CmakeLists.txt* to generate a `Makefile` for your system. This looks well on my MacOS, but don't know how it works on Windows.

## Usage

```shell
cd cmake-bulid-debug/ # or something else, depends.
make
./MusicController
```

# Files

- *main.cpp* : Main program.
- *include/* : Head files. You can add more libraries in this directory.
- *source/* : Other cpp files.
